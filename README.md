# Land Manager

## Description: 
This project summarizes (in a simple and short way) what I learned about C programming in my first year at university.

## C Training - Practice Goals:
### - ADT's (Abstract Data Types)
### - Dinamic memory allocation
### - Void pointers
### - Pointers to functions
### - File manipulation
### - Vector sorting using qsort()
### - Binary search using bsearch()
### - Dispatch tables

## Exercise:
### Make a land management program
### Each terrain will have:
- 1: Owner
- 2: Date of last cleaning
- 3: Address
- 4: Area
- 5: Associate brokerage

### Functionalities:
- 0: EXIT

- 4: ORDER LAND BY AREA (Descending order)
- 5: LIST LAND BY BROKER
- 6: ORDER BY DATE OF LAST CLEANING (From dirtiest to cleanest)
- 7: SEARCH FOR TERRAIN BY ADDRESS
